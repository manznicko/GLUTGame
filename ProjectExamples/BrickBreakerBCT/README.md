Works fairly well but does have a problem with collision between blocks and the ball were in certain cases the ball will phasing through a block and destroy it but, won't change directions and will just keep phasing through blocks till it properly collides with a block and turns around. 

I believe this is caused by the collision between the edge of a block and the edge of the ball hitting but, I don't need this project anymore and don't care to fix it at this time.
